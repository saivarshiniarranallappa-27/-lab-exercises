#  **Experiment No. 06 — Digital Forensic Analysis using Sleuth Kit (TSK)**

##  **Overview**

The **Sleuth Kit (TSK)**  is a versatile suite of command-line tools used in **digital forensics**.  
It enables investigators to analyze disk images , uncover deleted files , and extract critical digital evidence  from storage devices.  
This document walks through the complete process of using Sleuth Kit on a **Windows** system to perform forensic analysis.

## **Step 1: Installing Sleuth Kit**

1. **Download the Tool:**  
   - Head over to the official Sleuth Kit page or use this link:  
      [Download Sleuth Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ilSFY7Tqn2L7AjQGhq8yJ8kixc_xTU-v)  
   - Choose the latest stable **Windows-compatible** version.

2. **Installation Process:**  
   - Run the installer and follow the setup wizard .  
   - Once done, TSK will be ready to use on your system!

##  **Step 2: Acquire the Disk Image**

Before analysis, a **forensic disk image** (a perfect bit-by-bit copy) of the device is needed.

1. **Create Disk Image:**  
   - Use tools like **FTK Imager**  or **`dd`** to create an exact copy.  
   - Save it in a TSK-supported format: `.dd`, `.raw`, `.img`, or `.E01`.

2. **Sample Evidence Files:**  
   - For this lab, download the following from the provided link:  
      `4Dell Latitude CPi.E01`  
      `4Dell Latitude CPi.E02`

---

##  **Step 3: Mounting the Disk Image (Optional)**

Mounting lets you access the disk image as if it were a normal drive.

- Use **OSFMount**  to mount the image in **read-only mode**.  
-  *Note: This is optional but helps when browsing the file system.*

##  **Step 4: File System Analysis with TSK**

Now let’s dive into Sleuth Kit tools  to inspect the file system.

###  Navigate to the TSK Directory


```bash
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32\bin"
```

*Recovers a deleted or existing file by its inode number.*

---

##  **Step 5: Metadata Analysis**

To uncover file history and access details, view the file’s metadata.

##  **Step 6: Report Generation**

After completing your analysis:

1. **Compile All Outputs:**  
   Collect files like `filesystem_info.txt`, `partitions.txt`, `file_list.txt`, and `timeline.txt`.

2. **Interpret and Document:**  
   Write a clear summary  explaining your findings, methods used, and any key recovered evidence.

---

##  **Step 7: Evidence Preservation**

Ensuring the integrity of evidence is the final and most important step .

1. **Archive Evidence Securely:**  
   Use encryption  and hashing  to store your disk image and findings.

2. **Maintain Chain of Custody:**  
   Keep the evidence in a secure location following proper forensic protocols .
